 headlines eggdrop script by lee8oi@gmail.com
 https://github.com/lee8oi/headlines/blob/master/headlines.tcl

 There's plenty of eggdrop news syndication scripts if you are looking for
 something automatic. This script is for retrieving news headlines(titles w/links)
 Right from the source. The source can be a feed url directly or it can be the
 name of one of the preconfigured feeds followed by the number of headlines you would
 like. The output is sent to your nick through the irc notice system keeping the
 public channels spam free. The direct approach to handling feeds allows the script
 manage more news sources and it keeps a small foot print in memory because nothing
 is stored, and nothing is running when nobody is reading the news. We only get the
 headlines we ask for, when we ask for them, nothing else.

 This script is currently written for utf-8 patched bots and assumes the users
 system is utf-8. It currenly supports RSS and Atom feeds.

 Note: Encoding issues are common. If you have problems please make sure your
 bot is patched for utf-8 as outlined here: http://eggwiki.org/Utf-8

 If you still have problems consider updating to the latest tcl8.6 and
 recompiling your bot. This script DOES WORK. Its just hard to detect & fix all the
 possible encoding issues up front. I'll work in the fixes as I go. Check the
 'Custom Charsets' section in 'Configuration' for more information about
 setting charsets for specific feeds.

 Currently you can call the rss script from any channel the bot resides in or
 by using /msg or /query. The output is 'noticed' directly to you.

 Usage:

 Retrieve news:
 !news <feedname-or-url> ?how-many?

 List the available feeds
 !feeds
