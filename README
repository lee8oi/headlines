# headlines eggdrop script by lee8oi@gmail.com
#
# There's plenty of eggdrop news syndication scripts if you are looking for something automatic. 
# This script is for retrieving news now. Right from the source. The source can be a feed url directly or
# it can be the name of one of the preconfigured feeds. The output is sent to your nick through
# the irc notice system keeping the public channels spam free. The direct approach to handling feeds
# allows the script manage more news sources than your average eggdrop news script. We only get the
# news we ask for, when we ask for it, nothing else.
# 
# This script is currently written for utf-8 patched bots and assumes the users system is utf-8.
# It currenly supports RSS and Atom feeds. Its main job is to retrieve the headlines(titles & links).
# You can specify feed by feed name or use a url and optionally followed by how many headlines
# you would like to see.
#
# Note: Encoding issues are common. If you have problems please make sure your bot is patched for
# utf-8 as outlined here: http://eggwiki.org/Utf-8
# If you still have problems consider updating to the latest tcl8.6 and recompiling your bot. This
# script DOES WORK. Its just hard to fix all the possible encoding issues up front. I'll work in the
# fixes as I go. Check the 'Custom Charsets' section in 'Configuration' for more information about
# setting charsets for specific feeds.
#
# Currently you can call the rss script from any channel the bot resides in or by using /msg or /query. 
# The output is 'noticed' directly to you.
#
# Usage:
#
# Retrieve news:
# !news <feedname-or-url> ?how-many?
#
# List the available feeds
# !feeds
